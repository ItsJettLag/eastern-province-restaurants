# Establishment Analysis in Eastern Saudi Arabia

This project is built around scraping the data from google maps and other sources, anything I can get my hands on, followed by processessing and analyzing a dataset of 3,000+ establishments in Eastern Saudi Arabia using Python, Scala, Apache Spark, Databricks, and AWS S3. The aim is to derive insights from the dataset based on ratings, types, and geographic locations of businesses, and to perform geospatial analysis for identifying commercial hubs and high-density business areas.

**Please Note that only the code for scraping and the cleaned Dataframe (before the Spark queries werer run) have been uploaded to the repo. This is not the complete pipeline**

## Project Overview

This project involves scraping, processing and analyzing restaurant data in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, namely Jubail, Dammam, Khobar, Khafji, Qatif and Dhahran, using programming languages, APIs and big data tools. The dataframe contains information on 9 aspects of the establishments' ratings, reviews, establishment types, locations (longitude and latitude), address, city and services offered. The goal is to extract meaningful insights about commercial areas and business hubs. Not all fields were used or relevant in the project but I have left them all in the dataframe anyway.

### Objectives:
- Scrape the Data from Maps
- Find other sources of data
- Ingest the Data and bring all datasets to a common format with common fields
- Clean and preprocess the data and create a unified dataframe
- Perform data transformation and analysis to extract insights based on types of businesses, ratings, and locations. This was done on Databricks using Sparks SQL engine
- Conduct geospatial clustering using latitude and longitude to identify high-density business areas.
- Deploy the pipeline on Databricks and store the processed data in AWS S3 for scalability and accessibility.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python, Scala
- **Framework:** Apache Spark
- **Platform:** Databricks
- **Cloud Storage:** AWS S3
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Spark SQL with geospatial functions

## Data Pipeline

The project consists of an end-to-end ETL pipeline built using Apache Spark:

1. **Extract**: Find sources of Data, Scrape and Load the dataset of establishments from a bunch of sources including CSV files, Google maps (using serpAPI) etc.
2. **Transform**: 
   - Data cleaning (handling missing values, correcting data types, etc.).
   - Data transformation (normalizing business categories, analyzing ratings).
   - Loading the data to DBFS and creating a Spark Dataframe to perform basic Data analysis.
   - Geospatial transformation (clustering establishments by geographic coordinates).
3. **Load**: Save the processed data to AWS S3 for scalable cloud storage and future use.

## Geospatial Analysis

The geospatial analysis component of the project clusters businesses based on their latitude and longitude. Using Sparkâ€™s distributed processing capabilities, we identified key commercial hubs and areas with high business density in Eastern Saudi Arabia.

### Key Metrics:
- Number of establishments in each cluster.
- Average rating of businesses within each cluster.
- Types of businesses (restaurants, retail, etc.) predominant in each cluster.

## AWS S3 Integration

The processed and analyzed data is stored on AWS S3 to ensure accessibility and scalability. This integration allows for efficient data storage and retrieval from the cloud.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites: (Once the entire project is uploaded)
- Databricks account for running the pipeline.
- AWS S3 bucket for storing the processed data.
- Scala and Spark installed locally (if testing locally).

### Steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ItsJettLag/establishments-analysis-saudi-arabia.git
